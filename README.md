Command lines used for results analysis, declined per paper published by CRSV members

Here we are releasing bioinformatic protocols used for our microbiota analysis through 16S amplicon sequencing. This will boost reproducibility of our research and we encourage other research labs to do the same. 

In Science, in the guide to authors for preparing an initial manuscript (http://www.sciencemag.org/authors/instructions-preparing-initial-manuscript), in the Materials and Methods section it can be read: “The materials and methods section should provide sufficient information to allow replication of the results." As scientists and potential manuscript reviewers, we believe that releasing the code used for any bioinformatic analysis is essential to truly achieve this goal, especially because a lot of results and conclusions are drawn from these analyses from which a simple modification can result in a different output.

Otherwise, scientists are acting like a certain grandma who never fully disclosed her full recipe for her delicious deserts! It took a lot of time and numerous trials to be able to reproduce the true flavor of her famed egg pie and even then, nobody is sure at 100% that the are getting the same results as she would have. 

And DO NOT forget to CITE any relevant paper if you get “inspired” for your analysis!

Cheers!
